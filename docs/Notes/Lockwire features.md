		- When user receives notification to sign in / sign up. And he knows he wasn't in the process of signing in, or the site is different from the one he tried to sign in. Then user may choose "Reject", which will mark session with the device as compromised. By doing that we will know which other sites may be affected, because we will know on which sites the device has been signed in
		- Phishing protection - user cannot put credentials to different origin
	- 100% open sourced
	- Passwords approach has limits - they will be longer and longer, Ideally unique password for every service. This is hard to remember
