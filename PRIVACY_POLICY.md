###### Jan 23 2024

Our Privacy Policy explains how Lockwire handles Personal Data, which is information linked to an identified or
identifiable individual. It also outlines your options regarding this data. If you have any questions, feel free
to reach out to us at [admin@lockwire.app](email:admin@lockwire.app) via email.

## Applicability of This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers our mobile apps, desktop apps, and web browser extensions, which we collectively refer
to as the "Services". If you don't agree with this policy, please refrain from accessing or using our Services or
any other part of Lockwire's operations. Just to be clear, this is the only privacy policy that applies to Lockwire.

## Data We Collect
When you sign up to use our Services, you provide us with the following categories of personal data:

#### Email
Your email is essential for account creating and identification. It will also serve as the default
address for incoming email forwarding through our email alias feature. This information is stored by our services.

#### Mobile number
You can share your phone number for two-factor authentication and SMS account recovery. By doing
so, you agree to receive SMS messages from Lockwire at the provided number, with possible message and data charges.
This information may be stored by our services.

#### Account password
Users need to create a password to access their Lockwire account and generate encryption keys for
securing their stored data within our Services. It's important to note that **we do not store** this information anywhere.

#### Encrypted vault
Users can choose to enable the vault backup feature. The vault serves as an encrypted database
where all used private information is stored. We do not have the ability to view the contents of this database.
Access to the vault is rendered ineffective without both an account password and master password.

#### Billing Data
Lockwire uses third-party payment processors to handle payments on our services. In some cases,
we may store certain payment details like the expiration date and last four digits of your credit card for regulatory,
legal, tax compliance, or customer support purposes. However, please be assured that we do not retain your complete
credit card numbers or full payment data. Payment-related information, such as your name, address, and phone number,
is managed by our payment processors and is only accessible to specific individuals with role-based access. This access
is maintained securely, with confidentiality obligations, and only when there is a legitimate need to access this
information. Additionally, we do not receive or store any billing data when payments are made for a Lockwire
subscription through the Google Play or Apple App Store.

#### Third-Party Sources.
Users may enable the email aliasing feature. With this feature, we offer user a unique email address for sign-up
purposes on third-party sites or services. If these third-party sites or services send emails, such as confirmation
links, two-factor codes, or marketing messages, we will forward those emails without modification to the user's
provided email address during the alias feature setup.

We will process the content of these emails to extract confirmation links and two-factor codes to enhance the user
experience. Afterward, this extracted data will be encrypted and transmitted through a secure protocol to the user.
It's important to note that we do not retain this data, and no other parties can access the content of these
encrypted messages. User have an option choose to opt-out email processing.

## How do we store and protect your personal information?
We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical, business and technical
security measures. Our services are designed with a core principle of ensuring user anonymity in the event of a data leak.

We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what
we collected it for. Once we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.

## What do we do with your information once we have it?
When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission. Generally, we use your 
information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.

## When do we share your information with others?
With third-party service providers (such as IT and security service vendors, website hosting facilities, and email 
distribution services), contractors, and other third-parties we use to support our business. Such third-parties operate 
under appropriate confidentiality and data privacy obligations (only for the purposes identified in Section 
"What do we do with your information once we have it");

## What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?
We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be posted online. If the changes are substantive,
we will announce the update by user email used during sign up process.
Your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of
such changes. To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.
